Disable Hibernation

Be aware that hibernation (suspend to disk or S4 sleep) is not supported on hackintosh.
You should disable it:
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
 
Always check your hibernatemode after updates and disable it. System updates tend to re-enable it, although the trick above (making sleepimage a directory) tends to help.

And it may be a good idea to disable the other hibernation related options:
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
 
=========
Custom SSDT.aml using ssdtPRGen.sh
To prepare, you only need to do the first two commands:
With newer computers (Broadwell, Skylake, and future), make sure you use the beta branch:
cd ~
curl -o ./ssdtPRGen.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh/Beta/ssdtPRGen.sh
chmod +x ./ssdtPRGen.sh

#Then you can run the script:
./ssdtPRGen.sh

When it asks if you want to copy to /Extra just respond 'n'. Same for opening ssdt.dsl... respond 'n'.

The results are at ~/Library/ssdtPRGen/SSDT.aml.

Assuming your EFI partition is mounted at /Volumes/EFI, copy that file to EFI partition, /EFI/Clover/ACPI/patched/SSDT.aml

cd ~
cp ~/Library/ssdtPRGen/ssdt.aml /Volumes/EFI/EFI/Clover/ACPI/patched/SSDT.aml
 
=========================
Testing PM:
cd ~/Downloads
sudo mkdir /kexts
sudo cp -R AppleIntelInfo.kext /kexts
 
Now load it:
sudo kextutil /kexts/AppleIntelInfo.kext

Now use your computer to do a variety of tasks, benchmarks, etc.
You can look at the AppleIntelInfo.kext results:

# view with page control
sudo cat /tmp/AppleIntelInfo.dat|more
 
Or make a copy of the file that you can load in TextEdit:
Code (Text):

# create copy of it
sudo cp /tmp/AppleIntelInfo.dat AppleIntelInfo.txt
# open in TextEdit
open AppleIntelInfo.txt
 In addition, for Ivy Bridge and later (eg. Ivy, Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, KabyLake, etc), you should run IORegistryExplorer and verify that X86PlatformPlugin is loading under the CPU0 node.
===================
How to Test Power Management

1. Download and compile AppleIntelInfo.kext using XCode. Or download here: View attachment AppleIntelInfo.kext.zip .

2. Drag AppleIntelInfo.kext to desktop

3. Open Terminal

4. Type:

Code (Text):
sudo -s
5. Type:

Code (Text):
chown -R 0:0 ~/Desktop/AppleIntelInfo.kext
6. Type:

Code (Text):
chmod -R 755 ~/Desktop/AppleIntelInfo.kext
7. Type:

Code (Text):
kextload ~/Desktop/AppleIntelInfo.kext
8. Type:

Code (Text):
cat /tmp/AppleIntelInfo.dat
The amount of power states will then show in the Terminal window.
===================
NVRAM Testing: You can test if your NVRAM is working by running the following Terminal command and rebooting: 
sudo nvram TestVar=HelloWorld
once you reboot, run:
sudo nvram -p | grep 'TestVar'
if you see a result, your NVRAM is working; if not, your NVRAM is broken and needs to be fixed, or otherwise iMessage won't work; after testing, you can delete the TestVar variable by running 
sudo nvram -d TestVar
